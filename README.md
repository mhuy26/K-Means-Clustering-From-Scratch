# K-Means-Clustering-From-Scratch
This repository contains an algorithm for clustering soccer players using K-Means clustering. The algorithm groups players based on their attributes, such as overall rating, potential, value, wage, and age. The steps involved in the clustering process are detailed below.

<h1>Steps:</h1>
<h3>1. Scale data</h3>
<h3>2. Initialize random centroids</h3>
<h3>3. Lable each data point</h3>
<h3>4. Update centroids</h3>
<h3>5. Repeate 3+4 until centroids stop changing</h3>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<h3>Python:</h3>
a versatile programming language widely used in data science and machine learning for its simplicity and powerful libraries.

<h3>Pandas</h3>
a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. It is used for reading and processing the CSV file, handling missing data, and performing data transformations.

<h3>NumPy</h3>
a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and includes mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

<h3>Matplotlib</h3> 
a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

<h3>Scikit-learn</h3> 
a machine learning library in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, including the implementation of K-Means clustering.
